# Version with location based editing
In regard of improved GNNS Technologie i.e.: Dual Band GPS in todays smartphones an even finer positing is possible. With this option in better precicion locating several new usecases come to reality. Especially in the mapping rather than the surveying world, this new development comes in handy to quickly aquire spatial data. In combination with the Vespucci App, which offers a whole editor and Viewer for OpenStreetMap Data, an more accurate positioning improves the creating of OSM geodata or helps to improve existing data. Therefore we implemented some changes to the oringinal Vespucci App to make this described usecase possible. It is now possible to switch between the regular editing functions and the new implemented GNNS functionality for positioning.

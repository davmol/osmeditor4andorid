<h1>Vespucci Property Editor</h1>
<p>The property editor screen is the central place for changing object attributes and relation memberships. To exit and save your changes tap the back icon in the upper left hand corner, pressing the device back button will give you the option of exiting without saving. Tags with empty value fields will not be saved.</p>
<p>Most of the fields use context sensitive auto complete provided by the active presets. Clicking twice (with a short pause) will re-display the auto complete menu.</p>
<p>Depending on size and orientation of your device the layout will change to make maximum use of the space available.</p>
<ul>
<li>small devices: tab layout with <em>Presets</em>, <em>Properties</em> (including the recently used presets), <em>Details</em> and <em>Relations</em> tabs. If the selected object is a relation a further <em>Members</em> tab will be available.</li>
<li>large devices in portrait orientation: multi pane layout with a pane for the tabs, one for the <em>Recently Used Presets</em> and for the <em>Presets</em> screen</li>
</ul>
<p>If the property editor is started with multiple elements selected only the <em>Details</em> and <em>Presets</em> tabs will be available. Tabs can be changed by swiping or by tapping the header.</p>
<p>If the <em>Display tag form</em> preference in the <em>Advanced preferences</em> has been disabled pre-0.9.8 behaviour is enabled and the <em>Details</em> tab will have the heading <em>Properties</em>.</p>
<p>In the tabs tapping the checkbox in the header row will select/de-select all elements.</p>
<h2>Properties Tab</h2>
<p>This tab gives a simplified, preset-driven, editing screen for the tags on the selected object on which the keys are represented by their description. To remove individual attributes you can simple remove or reset the value (or delete them in the <em>Details</em> tab).</p>
<p>Fields are added by applying presets, either via the <em>Preset</em> tab or via the <img src="../images/tag_menu_apply_preset.png" alt="Preset" /> <em>Apply best preset</em> button.</p>
<h2>Details Tab</h2>
<p>Display of the key - value attributes of the edited object.</p>
<p>The following operations can be performed on selected tags</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete - delete the tag from the current object</li>
<li>Copy - copy the tag to the internal clipboard and to the system clipboard in a text representation.</li>
<li>Cut - same as copy, but delete the tag from this object.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special auto complete behaviour</h3>
<p>If the key of a field is &quot;addr:street&quot; a list of the nearest roads in the downloaded data will be provided.</p>
<p>If the key is &quot;name&quot;, selection of a value from the auto complete list will add corresponding tags and if enabled in the settings, apply an appropriate preset. Typical use case: add a name key and start typing &quot;mcd&quot;, select &quot;McDonalds's&quot; from the auto completion list and an amenity with the correct tags and name spelling will be added.</p>
<p>If multiple objects with different values for the same tags are being edited, such value fields will display 'Multiple values' and the auto-complete list will contain the existing values with a count. Setting the value to a specific value will set it for all objects, an empty value will leave the values untouched.</p>
<h3><img src="../images/address.png" alt="Address" /> Add address tags</h3>
<p>Add address tags for the object. This function will try to predict the house number to suggest. It works best along straight roads with regular numbering schemes.</p>
<h3><img src="../images/tag_menu_apply_preset.png" alt="Preset" /> Apply best preset</h3>
<p>Will locate the best matching preset to the existing tags and apply the preset adding further suggested fields.</p>
<h3><img src="../images/tag_menu_repeat.png" alt="Paste" /> Paste</h3>
<p>Paste and merge the tags from the internal clipboard.</p>
<h3><img src="../images/undolist_undo.png" alt="Revert" /> Revert</h3>
<p>Tapping the icon once will reset the tags to the values as they were when the property editor was started.</p>
<h3>Paste from clipboard</h3>
<p>Paste and merge multi-line text from the system clipboard. If the lines have the form <em>key</em>=<em>value</em> the lines will be split at the = and pasted in to key and values fields, otherwise the complete lines will be copied to the value field. This function can be used for example with OCR apps.</p>
<h3><img src="../images/tag_menu_sourcesurvey.png" alt="Surveyed" /> Surveyed</h3>
<p>Short cut for adding source=survey to the object. This is deprecated, the normal place to add source tags is in the corresponding field on the upload form. The action is only available on the <em>Details</em> tab.</p>
<h3><img src="../images/tag_menu_mapfeatures.png" alt="Wiki" /> Map Features Wiki</h3>
<p>Invoke a web browser on the map features page in the OpenStreetMap wiki. <em>(requires network connectivity)</em></p>
<h3>Reset address prediction</h3>
<p>Empty the current address cache and re-seed from downloaded OpenStreetMap data.</p>
<h3>Reset Presets</h3>
<p>Reset the most recently used preset list and remove short cuts from the tag editor screen.</p>

<p>The following operation can be performed on selected relation members.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Delete</em> - remove the object from this (the edited) relation.</li>
<li><em>Move up</em> - move the member up one position.</li>
<li><em>Move down</em> - move the member down one position.</li>
<li><em>Sort</em> - sort ways so that they are connected, nodes and relations retain the order that they have and are placed above the ways.</li>
<li><em>Reverse order</em> - reverse the order of the selected members.</li>
<li><em>Move to top</em> - move the member to the top of the list.</li>
<li><em>Move to bottom</em> - move the member to the bottom of the list.</li>
<li><em>Download</em> - download the selected members.  if all members are selected the members will be downloaded including ways that are parents of nodes that are a relation member, otherwise the individual members are downloaded and for nodes the parent ways are <strong>not</strong> downloaded.</li>

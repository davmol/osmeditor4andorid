<h1>Preferences</h1>
<p>The settings for Vespucci are split over two screens: standard and advanced preferences. The more commonly used settings should in general be in the first screen.</p>
<h2>Map background</h2>
<p>Select the tiled imagery background layer. Selection will be filtered to layers that cover the current map view.</p>
<h2>Map overlay</h2>
<p>Select the tiled imagery overlay layer. Selection will be filtered to layers that cover the current map view.</p>
<h2>Custom layers</h2>
<p>Configure a custom imagery layer not included in the standard configuration.</p>
<h2>Scale display</h2>
<p>Configure the scale or grid displayed.</p>
<h2>Data style</h2>
<p>The style that is used to render OpenStreetmapData. Additional style can be added by including corresponding files in the Vespucci directory.</p>
<h2>Display tasks</h2>
<p>Turn on the task layer (currently supporting OSM Notes, OSMOSE bugs, Maproulette and custom tasks).</p>
<h2>Enable Photo layer</h2>
<p>Turn on the photo layer. When enabled the Vespucci directory and others will be scanned for geo-referenced photographs that will be displayed with a camera icon and are selectable (selecting will try to start a photo viewer on the device).</p>
<h2>Keep screen on</h2>
<p>Disable the Android automatic screen lock.</p>
<h2>Large node drag area</h2>
<p>Display a large ring around selected nodes making draging and positioning nodes easier.</p>
<h2>Presets</h2>
<p>Start preset management screen. Vespucci supports JOSM style presets that can be downloaded and added from this screen.</p>
<h2>Validator settings</h2>
<h3>Validator settings</h3>
<p>Configure the standard validator.</p>
<p>There are currently two configurable checks: a check for missing keys and an aged based one for re-surveying.</p>
<p>The missing tag check works on the combination of the keys that should be checked and the preset for element.</p>
<p>Example: the default configuration checks that a &quot;name&quot; tag is present on a object if the matching preset contains a &quot;name&quot; field in the non-optional tags, optionally the check can be extended to require &quot;optional&quot; tags.</p>
<h3>Connected node tolerance</h3>
<p>Configure how far away from a highway a highway end node must be to not be highlighted as an error.</p>
<h2>Advanced preferences</h2>
<p>Starts the advanced preferences editor.</p>

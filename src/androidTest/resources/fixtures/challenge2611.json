This is wrong and leads to wrong renderings. Note that some tags can be the same, say you have a coniferous forest with a deciduous forest in the middle. But all tags being the same doesn't make sense. (Certain tags such as \"source\" are ignored in this comparison.) A member way should only have the tags describing that specific way only, not anything belonging to the whole multipolygon.","deleted":false,"blurb":"Quite often some of the outer or inner ways in a multipolygon relation have the same tags as the relation itself.
